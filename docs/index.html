        Summing Matrices

        <p>That I can remember, I've always liked numbers. The ways they behave and relate has always aroused my interest. While
            I was in college, there were always fun mathematical problems to solve running around the corridors and I was
            one, amongst a bunch of people, who got entertained by trying to solve them. At some point, this simple problem
            showed up:</p>
        <p><b>Fill a 3 by 3 square with the numbers from 1 to 9 so that the sum of the numbers on every row, column and both diagonals are the same.</b></p>
        <p>
            Afther a little trial and error, the solution is easy to achieve:
        </p>
        <table class="result">
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>9</td>
                <td>4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>7</td>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>3</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>8</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>And the sum of the numbers on every row column and both diagonals is <b>15</b>.</p>
        <p>And, as usual, solving just the problem at hand isn't enough. I embarked in the taks of trying to solve the same
            problem for a 5 by 5 square. After a little bit more trial and error than the first time, the solution presented
            itself:
        </p>
        <table class="result">
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>20</td>
                <td>7</td>
                <td>24</td>
                <td>11</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>16</td>
                <td>8</td>
                <td>25</td>
                <td>12</td>
                <td>4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>9</td>
                <td>21</td>
                <td>13</td>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>17</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>22</td>
                <td>14</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>18</td>
                <td>10</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>15</td>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>19</td>
                <td>6</td>
                <td>23</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Where the sum of the numbers on every row column and both diagonals is <b>65</b>.</p>
        <p>At this point, I thought it must be likely that all odd-sided squares have a similar solution and, consequently,
            there must be a generic way to solve this problem for all. And, following that conviction, I started looking
            for patterns and some stand out with the "naked eye".</p>

        <ul>
            <li>In the middle of the square goes medium (the middle nummber): <b>5</b> in 3x3; <b>13</b> in 5x5</li>
            <li>Bellow medium number goes the first number, i.e., <b>1</b></li>
            <li>Over medium number goes the last number: <b>9</b> in 3x3; <b>25</b> in 5x5</li>
            <li>Top-right to bottom-left diagonal is in sequence, having the medium number, in the middle, which gives the most
                important data to work with, i.e., the <b>sum value</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li><b class="highlight_diagonal">4</b>, <b class="highlight_medium">5</b> and <b class="highlight_diagonal">6</b>in

        <p>Having this starting point, I took the task of solving the 7 by 7 square.</p>
